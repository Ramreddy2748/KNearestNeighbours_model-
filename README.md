# Wine Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for exploring and analyzing the Wine dataset. The Wine dataset is a classic dataset often used for classification tasks, and it contains various attributes related to the chemical composition of wines.

## Dataset Description

The Wine dataset is loaded using scikit-learn's `load_wine` function. It includes the following features:

- Alcohol
- Malic acid
- Ash
- Alcalinity of ash
- Magnesium
- Total phenols
- Flavanoids
- Nonflavanoid phenols
- Proanthocyanins
- Color intensity
- Hue
- OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
- Proline

The target variable is the wine class (0, 1, or 2).

## Code

The Jupyter Notebook (`Wine_Dataset_Analysis.ipynb`) in this repository provides a step-by-step analysis of the Wine dataset. It covers data loading, exploration, visualization, and potentially machine learning tasks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
